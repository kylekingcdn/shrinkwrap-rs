# `shrinkwrap`

`shrinkwrap` is a Rust library to assist in automating the nesting, wrapping, and merging of alternate representations for arbitrary data structs.

E.g, conditionally rendering text/human-readable variants of common data in an API response object (such as: timestamps, numeric precision adjustments, currency exchange rate handling).
